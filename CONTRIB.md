## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html) v0.230+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Getting started

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd agent-builder-app

# Authenticate with your workspace
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Running locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend (auto-reloads on save)
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: frontend with hot reload
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server runs on `:3000` and proxies `/api` requests to the backend on `:8000`.

**Auth in local dev:** There is no OBO token locally. `_get_mcp_client()` falls through to `get_data_client()` which uses your Databricks CLI credentials (from `databricks auth login`). MCP URLs are built from `DATABRICKS_HOST` in your environment. You can also paste a PAT in the builder banner for testing.

### Building for deployment

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # outputs to backend/static/
```

The FastAPI backend serves the built frontend as static files in production.

## Authentication Model

This is important to understand before contributing. The app uses three credential types.

### Managed MCP routing (the key design decision)

All data-access nodes (Vector Search, Genie, UC Functions) route through [Databricks managed MCP servers](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/mcp/managed-mcp) instead of calling the SDK directly. This is the mechanism that eliminates the PAT requirement for preview.

**Background:** The direct SDK APIs require OBO scopes (`vector-search`, `genie`, etc.) that Databricks Apps cannot configure — the platform rejects them. We verified this empirically with a diagnostic endpoint. However, Databricks _does_ support `mcp.*` OBO scopes that route requests through the MCP proxy gateway:

| Node type | MCP URL pattern | OBO scope |
|---|---|---|
| Vector Search | `/api/2.0/mcp/vector-search/{catalog}/{schema}/{index}` | `mcp.vectorsearch` |
| Genie | `/api/2.0/mcp/genie/{room_id}` | `mcp.genie` |
| UC Functions | `/api/2.0/mcp/functions/{catalog}/{schema}/{function}` | `mcp.functions` |
| External MCP | `/api/2.0/mcp/external/{connection}` | `mcp.external` |

These scopes are declared in `databricks.yml` under `user_api_scopes`. The OBO token from the Apps proxy carries these scopes, and the MCP servers enforce Unity Catalog permissions server-side.

**If direct SDK OBO scopes (`vector-search`, `genie`, etc.) become available in the future**, the MCP routing can be replaced with direct SDK calls — the auth fallback path through `get_data_client()` is still in place. This would eliminate the ~1-2s per-tool MCP protocol overhead (see Latency section below).

### Latency tradeoff

MCP routing adds a **fixed overhead per tool call** — roughly 1-2 seconds for MCP session setup (TCP connect → HTTP POST → initialize handshake → tool call → close). This overhead is constant regardless of tool execution time.

Measured on serving endpoints (`mcp-test` vs `medical-assistant`, same graph, April 2026):

| Query type | MCP | Direct SDK | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| VS + Genie (fast Genie) | 21.6s | 16.6s | +5.0s (+30%) |
| Genie-heavy | 15.9s | 12.0s | +3.9s (+33%) |
| Long Genie query | 22.3s | 21.7s | +0.6s (+3%) |

The overhead is most visible on fast queries and negligible when Genie SQL execution dominates. Optimization opportunities (session reuse, parallel tool execution, skip discovery for known tools) are tracked in issue #14.

### VS configuration via `_meta`

Vector Search config options (reranker, columns, score threshold, filters, query type) are passed to the MCP server via the MCP spec's [`_meta` parameter](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/mcp/managed-mcp-meta-param), not as tool arguments. This separates user-preset configuration from LLM-generated query parameters. See `_build_vs_meta()` in `tools.py`. Genie and UC Functions do not currently support `_meta` parameters.

### Credential types

#### OBO (On-Behalf-Of) Token — primary for data access

Injected by the Apps proxy via `x-forwarded-access-token`. `OBOMiddleware` stores it in a contextvar. `_get_mcp_client()` in `tools.py` prefers this token for managed MCP URLs and Databricks Apps URLs.

**Used for:** All data access in preview (VS, Genie, UC Functions via managed MCP), user identity resolution.

**Important SDK behavior:** The Databricks SDK loads `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` from the environment into its Config even when you pass `token=`. If both are present, the server treats the request as an SP OAuth call (wrong scopes). `get_workspace_client()` masks these env vars before creating the client and passes `auth_type="pat"` to force bearer-token auth. Both are required.

#### User PAT (deploy operations only)

Users paste a PAT in the deploy modal for UC model registration and serving endpoint creation. Stored in browser memory only — no localStorage, no cookies, no disk. On the backend, held in a `ContextVar` for the request lifetime and cleared in `finally`.

**Used for:** UC model registration, serving endpoint creation (OBO scopes for these don't work).

#### Service Principal (SP)

Env vars `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` injected by the platform. Use `get_sp_workspace_client()`.

**Used for:** LLM calls (FMAPI rejects OBO tokens), MLflow experiment logging, setup config persistence.

### Summary

| Operation | Auth | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Preview — VS, Genie, UC Functions | OBO (via managed MCP) | `mcp.*` scopes in `databricks.yml` |
| Preview — MCP Server nodes | OBO > PAT | `DatabricksOAuthClientProvider`; managed URLs prefer OBO |
| Preview — LLM inference | SP | FMAPI rejects OBO and PAT |
| User identity | OBO | `iam.current-user:read` scope works |
| MLflow experiment logging | SP | No OBO scope for MLflow |
| Setup config persistence | SP | Workspace file write (SP has Can Manage) |
| UC model registration | PAT | No UC write OBO scopes |
| Serving endpoint creation | PAT | `model-serving` OBO scope unreliable |

### Implementation details

- `_managed_mcp_url()` in `tools.py` builds MCP URLs from node config. Ensures `https://` prefix since `DATABRICKS_HOST` may not include it in Apps/serving environments.
- `_persist_mcp_tool_metadata()` in `main.py` runs at deploy time: discovers MCP tools and persists both `discovered_tools` (tool schemas) and `mcp_server_url` (fully-qualified URL) into the graph artifact. This is critical — serving containers may not have `DATABRICKS_HOST` set correctly.
- `create_pat_client()` in `auth.py` handles PAT-authenticated `WorkspaceClient` creation with env var masking. For `mlflow.register_model()`, we run in a subprocess because MLflow caches `DatabricksConfig` via `@lru_cache` — env-var masking in the same process doesn't override it.

## Lakebase Connection Handling

Conversational agents need persistent state. The app uses Lakebase (Databricks-managed PostgreSQL) as a checkpoint store. Understanding the connection pattern matters if you're modifying the deploy flow or `mlflow_model.py`.

### Why not a static connection string?

Lakebase Autoscaling uses OAuth tokens that expire after 1 hour. A `postgresql://user:token@host/db` URI baked into an env var stops working after the first hour. Model Serving endpoints are long-running, so static credentials don't work.

### The pattern: ConnectionPool with token refresh

Instead of a static connection string, the serving endpoint gets three env vars:

| Env var | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` | `projects/my-agent/branches/production/endpoints/primary` | Resource path for `generate_database_credential()` |
| `LAKEBASE_HOST` | `ep-abc123.database.us-east-1.databricks.com` | Postgres hostname |
| `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` | `checkpoints` | Postgres database name |

At serving time (`mlflow_model.py`), the model creates a `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool` with a custom `psycopg.Connection` subclass. Each time the pool opens a new connection, the subclass calls `WorkspaceClient().postgres.generate_database_credential(endpoint=...)` to get a fresh 1-hour OAuth token and passes it as the password.

Key facts:
- **Open connections survive token expiry.** Lakebase enforces expiry only at login time, not on established connections.
- **The pool handles rotation transparently.** Existing connections keep working; new ones get fresh tokens.
- **`WorkspaceClient()` auto-detects credentials** in the Model Serving environment (SP identity).
- **`PostgresSaver` accepts `ConnectionPool` directly** — LangGraph calls `pool.connection()` for each checkpoint read/write.

A `LAKEBASE_CONN_STRING` fallback exists for non-Lakebase Postgres instances but should be avoided for Lakebase deployments.

### The deploy flow

1. User chooses "Create new" or "Use existing" in the Deploy modal
2. If "Create new": the deploy endpoint calls `provision_lakebase()` (in `backend/lakebase.py`) using the user's PAT to create a project + database
3. The three env vars are injected on the `ServedEntityInput` when creating the serving endpoint
4. If the user provides a raw connection string instead, it's injected as `LAKEBASE_CONN_STRING` (legacy path)

### Auth summary for Lakebase

| When | Who | How |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning (deploy time) | User | PAT-authenticated `WorkspaceClient` |
| Token generation (serving time) | Service Principal | SP credentials auto-detected by `WorkspaceClient()` |
| Postgres connection (serving time) | SP identity | OAuth token as password, SP email as username |

## Branching Model

| Branch | Purpose | Merges from | Protected |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production — deployed to the Databricks App | `dev` | Yes |
| `dev` | Integration — all feature work lands here first | feature branches | Yes |
| `your-name/description` | Feature branches | — | No |

**Workflow:** Create a feature branch from `dev`, open a PR back to `dev`. After testing on `dev`, promote to `main` via a separate PR.

### Branch protections

Both `dev` and `main` require:

- A pull request (no direct push)
- CI checks passing (`Frontend Build` + `Backend Tests`)
- 1 approval from a reviewer (repo admins can bypass)

## CI Pipeline

CI runs on every push and PR to `dev` and `main` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Frontend Build** | `npm ci` + `npm run build` (includes TypeScript type checking) |
| **Backend Tests** | `uv sync --dev` + `pytest -m "not integration"` |

Tests marked `@pytest.mark.integration` (e.g., those requiring live Databricks credentials) are skipped in CI. Run them locally:

```bash
uv run pytest  # runs all tests including integration
```

## Pull Requests

### Guidelines

- **One feature per PR.** Don't bundle unrelated changes. A new node type, a bug fix, and a UI tweak should be three separate PRs.
- **Keep diffs small.** If a feature touches many files, consider breaking it into stacked PRs (e.g., backend first, then frontend).
- **Don't refactor while fixing.** If you notice nearby code that could be improved, open a separate PR for it.
- **Test before opening.** Run the app locally and verify your change works in the preview canvas. If you're adding a node, test it with at least one graph that exercises it.
- **Run tests locally.** `uv run pytest -m "not integration" -q` should pass before you open a PR.
- **Update CONTRIB.md** if your change adds new patterns, config field types, or resource declarations that other contributors need to know about.

### Branch naming

Use `your-name/short-description` — e.g., `brennan.beal/add-sql-warehouse-node`.

### PR template

The repo includes a PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Fill it out when opening a PR — don't delete sections, mark them N/A if they don't apply.

## Adding a New Node Type

The agent builder uses auto-discovery — drop a file in `backend/nodes/` and it appears in the UI automatically.

### 1. Create the node file

Add `backend/nodes/your_node.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Any
from .base import BaseNode, NodeConfigField
from . import register

@register
class YourNode(BaseNode):
    @property
    def node_type(self) -> str:
        return "your_node"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Your Node"

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "One-line description shown in the palette."

    @property
    def category(self) -> str:
        return "action"  # model | retrieval | action | control

    @property
    def icon(self) -> str:
        return "puzzle"  # must be in NodeIcon.tsx ICON_MAP

    @property
    def color(self) -> str:
        return "#6366f1"  # hex color for the node header

    @property
    def config_fields(self) -> list[NodeConfigField]:
        return [
            NodeConfigField(name="param1", label="Param 1"),
        ]

    def execute(self, state: dict[str, Any], config: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        writes_to = config.get("_writes_to", "")
        # ... your logic ...
        return {
            writes_to: result,
            "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "...", "node": "your_node"}],
        }
```

That's it for the backend. The `@register` decorator + `pkgutil` auto-import in `__init__.py` handles discovery. The node will appear in the palette and config panel automatically.

### 2. Add icon mapping (if using a new icon)

In `frontend/src/components/NodeIcon.tsx`, add your icon to `ICON_MAP`:

```tsx
import { YourIcon } from "lucide-react";
// ...
const ICON_MAP = {
  // ...existing...
  "your-icon": YourIcon,
};
```

Unmapped icons fall back to the puzzle piece. Browse options at [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev).

### 3. Add resource declarations (if accessing Databricks resources)

If your node references external resources (endpoints, tables, functions, etc.), update `backend/main.py` so Model Serving provisions credentials:

1. Add to `resource_map` in `_extract_resources()`
2. Add to `init_param` mapping
3. Add to `_RESOURCE_MAP` in `backend/notebook_gen.py` (for generated deploy notebooks)

Available resource classes:

| Class | Config field example | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabricksServingEndpoint` | `endpoint`, `endpoint_name` | LLM, Vector Search |
| `DatabricksVectorSearchIndex` | `index_name` | Vector Search |
| `DatabricksGenieSpace` | `room_id` | Genie |
| `DatabricksFunction` | `function_name` | UC Function |
| `DatabricksTable` | `table_name` | — |

### 4. Add as a tool (if tool-compatible)

If your node can also be used as a tool attached to an LLM node:

1. Set `tool_compatible = True` on the node class
2. Add a tool factory function in `backend/tools.py` (e.g., `_make_your_tool()`)
3. Register it in the `make_tools()` switch statement

Tool functions route through managed MCP using `_get_mcp_client()` — OBO preferred for managed MCP URLs, `get_data_client()` fallback for everything else.

## Config Field Types

The config panel renders fields automatically based on `field_type`:

| `field_type` | Renders as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"text"` | Text input | Default |
| `"number"` | Number input | |
| `"textarea"` | Multi-line text | |
| `"select"` | Dropdown | Provide `options` list |
| `"state_variable"` | Dropdown of state vars | Supports dot-path for structured fields |
| `"schema_editor"` | Structured field editor | For LLM structured output |
| `"route_editor"` | Route builder | Router nodes only |

## Reading from State

Use `resolve_state()` from `base.py` when your node reads from a user-selected state variable. It handles both flat keys (`"input"`) and dot-paths into structured fields (`"output.query_filters"`):

```python
from .base import resolve_state

query = resolve_state(state, config.get("query_from", "input"))
```

## Router Nodes

If your node branches the graph:

1. Add `is_router = True` property
2. Implement `get_route_names(config) -> list[str]`
3. Return `{"_route": chosen_key}` from `execute()`

See `backend/nodes/router_node.py` for reference.

## Execute Contract

Your `execute()` receives:
- `state` — full agent state dict
- `config` — user-supplied config values, plus `_writes_to` (target state field) and `_target_field` (the `StateFieldDef`)

It must return a dict with:
- `writes_to: value` — the result to write into the target state field
- `"messages": [...]` — list of message dicts for the execution trace (each with `role`, `content`, `node`)

## App Scopes

The app declares OBO scopes in `databricks.yml` under `user_api_scopes`. These are the scopes the user's OAuth token will carry when they log in to the app.

**Currently configured scopes:**

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mcp.vectorsearch` | Vector Search queries via managed MCP |
| `mcp.genie` | Genie space queries via managed MCP |
| `mcp.functions` | UC function execution via managed MCP |
| `mcp.external` | External MCP connections (UC connection proxy) |

Default scopes (`iam.current-user:read`, `iam.access-control:read`) are included automatically.

**When you change scopes**, users must log out and back in (or use an incognito window) to get a new OAuth token with the updated scopes. This is a common gotcha — if preview returns 403 after a scope change, it's usually a stale token.

**Discovering available scopes:**

```bash
databricks api get /oidc/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq '.scopes_supported'
```

**Important:** Not all scopes listed in the OAuth discovery endpoint work as OBO scopes for Apps. Direct SDK scopes like `vector-search`, `genie`, `unity-catalog`, and `model-serving` appear in the list but do not reliably grant access — this is why all data access routes through managed MCP (`mcp.*` scopes) rather than the direct SDK. If direct SDK OBO scopes become available in the future, the MCP routing can be replaced to eliminate the protocol overhead.
