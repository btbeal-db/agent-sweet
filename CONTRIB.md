## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html) v0.230+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Getting started

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd agent-builder-app

# Authenticate with your workspace
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Running locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend (auto-reloads on save)
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: frontend with hot reload
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server runs on `:3000` and proxies `/api` requests to the backend on `:8000`.

**Auth in local dev:** There is no OBO token locally. `get_workspace_client()` falls back to your Databricks CLI credentials (from `databricks auth login`). This means local preview uses your identity directly.

### Building for deployment

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # outputs to backend/static/
```

The FastAPI backend serves the built frontend as static files in production.

## Authentication Model

This is important to understand before contributing:

- **App auth (OBO):** When running as a Databricks App, each request includes the user's OAuth token via `x-forwarded-access-token`. The `OBOMiddleware` in `main.py` stores it in a contextvar. `get_workspace_client()` in `auth.py` uses this token to create a user-scoped `WorkspaceClient`.

- **SP credentials masking:** The SDK rejects having both a token and client credentials present. `get_workspace_client()` temporarily masks `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` from the env when creating an OBO client. Do NOT pass `auth_type` to `WorkspaceClient` — let the SDK auto-detect.

- **LLM calls use SP credentials:** LLM nodes call Foundation Model API endpoints using the app's service principal (default env vars). FMAPI does not accept OBO tokens.

- **Data-access calls use OBO:** Vector Search, Genie, UC Function nodes all call `get_workspace_client()` which uses the user's token for per-user access control.

- **Deploy Job:** MLflow operations (log, register, create endpoint) are handled by a background Databricks Job, not by the app directly. The Job runs as its service principal.

## Pull Requests

### Guidelines

- **One feature per PR.** Don't bundle unrelated changes. A new node type, a bug fix, and a UI tweak should be three separate PRs.
- **Keep diffs small.** If a feature touches many files, consider breaking it into stacked PRs (e.g., backend first, then frontend).
- **Don't refactor while fixing.** If you notice nearby code that could be improved, open a separate PR for it.
- **Test before opening.** Run the app locally and verify your change works in the preview canvas. If you're adding a node, test it with at least one graph that exercises it.
- **Update CONTRIB.md** if your change adds new patterns, config field types, or resource declarations that other contributors need to know about.

### Branch naming

Use `your-name/short-description` — e.g., `brennan.beal/add-sql-warehouse-node`.

### PR template

The repo includes a PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Fill it out when opening a PR — don't delete sections, mark them N/A if they don't apply.

## Adding a New Node Type

The agent builder uses auto-discovery — drop a file in `backend/nodes/` and it appears in the UI automatically.

### 1. Create the node file

Add `backend/nodes/your_node.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Any
from .base import BaseNode, NodeConfigField
from . import register

@register
class YourNode(BaseNode):
    @property
    def node_type(self) -> str:
        return "your_node"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Your Node"

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "One-line description shown in the palette."

    @property
    def category(self) -> str:
        return "action"  # model | retrieval | action | control

    @property
    def icon(self) -> str:
        return "puzzle"  # must be in NodeIcon.tsx ICON_MAP

    @property
    def color(self) -> str:
        return "#6366f1"  # hex color for the node header

    @property
    def config_fields(self) -> list[NodeConfigField]:
        return [
            NodeConfigField(name="param1", label="Param 1"),
        ]

    def execute(self, state: dict[str, Any], config: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        writes_to = config.get("_writes_to", "")
        # ... your logic ...
        return {
            writes_to: result,
            "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "...", "node": "your_node"}],
        }
```

That's it for the backend. The `@register` decorator + `pkgutil` auto-import in `__init__.py` handles discovery. The node will appear in the palette and config panel automatically.

### 2. Add icon mapping (if using a new icon)

In `frontend/src/components/NodeIcon.tsx`, add your icon to `ICON_MAP`:

```tsx
import { YourIcon } from "lucide-react";
// ...
const ICON_MAP = {
  // ...existing...
  "your-icon": YourIcon,
};
```

Unmapped icons fall back to the puzzle piece. Browse options at [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev).

### 3. Add resource declarations (if accessing Databricks resources)

If your node references external resources (endpoints, tables, functions, etc.), update `backend/deploy_helpers.py` so Model Serving provisions credentials:

1. Add to `resource_map` in `extract_resources()`
2. Ensure the config field name maps to the correct MLflow resource class

Available resource classes:

| Class | Config field example | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabricksServingEndpoint` | `endpoint`, `endpoint_name` | LLM, Vector Search |
| `DatabricksVectorSearchIndex` | `index_name` | Vector Search |
| `DatabricksGenieSpace` | `room_id` | Genie |
| `DatabricksFunction` | `function_name` | UC Function |
| `DatabricksTable` | `table_name` | — |

### 4. Add as a tool (if tool-compatible)

If your node can also be used as a tool attached to an LLM node:

1. Set `tool_compatible = True` on the node class
2. Add a tool factory function in `backend/tools.py` (e.g., `_make_your_tool()`)
3. Register it in the `make_tools()` switch statement

Tool functions use `get_workspace_client()` for data access — same OBO auth as nodes.

## Config Field Types

The config panel renders fields automatically based on `field_type`:

| `field_type` | Renders as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"text"` | Text input | Default |
| `"number"` | Number input | |
| `"textarea"` | Multi-line text | |
| `"select"` | Dropdown | Provide `options` list |
| `"state_variable"` | Dropdown of state vars | Supports dot-path for structured fields |
| `"schema_editor"` | Structured field editor | For LLM structured output |
| `"route_editor"` | Route builder | Router nodes only |

## Reading from State

Use `resolve_state()` from `base.py` when your node reads from a user-selected state variable. It handles both flat keys (`"input"`) and dot-paths into structured fields (`"output.query_filters"`):

```python
from .base import resolve_state

query = resolve_state(state, config.get("query_from", "input"))
```

## Router Nodes

If your node branches the graph:

1. Add `is_router = True` property
2. Implement `get_route_names(config) -> list[str]`
3. Return `{"_route": chosen_key}` from `execute()`

See `backend/nodes/router_node.py` for reference.

## Execute Contract

Your `execute()` receives:
- `state` — full agent state dict
- `config` — user-supplied config values, plus `_writes_to` (target state field) and `_target_field` (the `StateFieldDef`)

It must return a dict with:
- `writes_to: value` — the result to write into the target state field
- `"messages": [...]` — list of message dicts for the execution trace (each with `role`, `content`, `node`)

## Deployment Architecture

The app has two independently deployed components:

| Component | Source | Deployed via |
|---|---|---|
| **App** (FastAPI + frontend) | Git repo | `databricks apps deploy` from Git |
| **Deploy Job notebook** | `backend/deploy_notebook.py` | `databricks bundle deploy` (uploads to workspace) |

When you change files, consider which component is affected:

- **UI or API changes** (anything in `frontend/`, `backend/main.py`, `backend/nodes/`, etc.) → push to Git + redeploy from Git
- **Deploy notebook changes** (`backend/deploy_notebook.py`, `backend/deploy_helpers.py`, `requirements-serving.txt`) → must run `databricks bundle deploy` so the Job picks up the updated notebook
- **Both** → run bundle deploy first, then git deploy

The deploy notebook is installed from Git by the Job at runtime (`pip install git+<repo>@<branch>`), but the notebook **itself** is loaded from the workspace path set by the bundle. This means changes to the notebook code require a bundle redeploy, while changes to the importable package code (e.g., `deploy_helpers.py`) are picked up automatically since they're installed from Git.

### Updating `requirements-serving.txt`

There are **two copies** of `requirements-serving.txt`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `requirements-serving.txt` (repo root) | Source of truth, used by `uv pip compile` |
| `backend/requirements-serving.txt` | Copy bundled into the pip package so the deploy notebook can find it at runtime |

The `backend/` copy exists because when the deploy Job installs the package via `pip install git+...`, the notebook resolves paths relative to `site-packages/backend/` — not the repo root. Without the copy, the file isn't found and models get logged with no dependencies.

**These files do not update automatically.** When you add or change dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, you must regenerate and copy:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements-serving.txt --python-version 3.10
cp requirements-serving.txt backend/requirements-serving.txt
```

Then commit both files, push, and redeploy the bundle (`databricks bundle deploy`).

This must target Python 3.10 (the Model Serving runtime). If you forget the copy step, deployed agents will fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` because their conda.yaml will only contain `mlflow`.

**Important:** The requirements file must not include `agent-builder-app` itself. The deploy notebook passes requirements as an explicit list to `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(pip_requirements=...)` to prevent MLflow from auto-detecting the installed package. If you see `agent-builder-app==X.Y.Z` in a serving endpoint's build logs, the notebook's requirements handling needs fixing.

## App Scopes

When adding integrations that call new Databricks APIs via OBO, you may need to add OAuth scopes. Scopes must be added in **two** places:

1. `databricks.yml` — declared in the app resource (for documentation; DABs doesn't reliably apply these)
2. `deploy.sh` — the `apps update` call that actually sets scopes on the app

Known valid scopes: `catalog.catalogs:read`, `catalog.schemas:read`, `catalog.tables:read`, `dashboards.genie`, `serving.serving-endpoints`, `sql`, `vectorsearch.vector-search-endpoints`, `vectorsearch.vector-search-indexes`

If you get a 403 with "required scopes: X", add scope `X` to both places.

## Quick Reference

| What | Where | Required? | Redeploy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node class with `@register` | `backend/nodes/your_node.py` | Yes | Git |
| Icon mapping | `frontend/src/components/NodeIcon.tsx` | Only if new icon | Git |
| Resource declarations | `backend/deploy_helpers.py` | Only if external resources | Bundle + Git |
| Tool factory | `backend/tools.py` | Only if tool-compatible | Git |
| OAuth scopes | `databricks.yml` + `deploy.sh` | Only if new API access | Bundle + re-run `deploy.sh` |
| Serving requirements | `requirements-serving.txt` + `backend/requirements-serving.txt` | Only if deps changed | Commit both + Bundle |
