# Contributing

## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html) v0.230+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Getting started

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd agent-builder-app

# Authenticate with your workspace
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Running locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend (auto-reloads on save)
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: frontend with hot reload
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server runs on `:3000` and proxies `/api` requests to the backend on `:8000`.

**Auth in local dev:** There is no OBO token locally. `get_workspace_client()` falls back to your Databricks CLI credentials (from `databricks auth login`). This means local preview uses your identity directly.

### Building for deployment

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # outputs to backend/static/
```

The FastAPI backend serves the built frontend as static files in production.

## Authentication Model

This is important to understand before contributing. The app uses three credential types depending on the operation:

### OBO (On-Behalf-Of) Token

Each request from a logged-in user includes their downscoped OAuth token via the `x-forwarded-access-token` header. `OBOMiddleware` in `main.py` stores it in a contextvar. `get_workspace_client()` in `auth.py` creates a user-scoped `WorkspaceClient` from it.

**Used for:** Playground/preview (Vector Search, Genie, UC Functions), catalog/schema read validation, setup permission grants.

**Important:** The Databricks SDK rejects requests when it sees both a token and OAuth client credentials. `get_workspace_client()` temporarily masks `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` from the env when creating an OBO client. Do NOT pass `auth_type` to `WorkspaceClient` — let the SDK auto-detect.

### Service Principal (SP)

The app's SP credentials are injected by the platform via env vars (`DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`). Use `get_sp_workspace_client()` from `auth.py`.

**Used for:** LLM calls (Foundation Model API doesn't accept OBO), MLflow experiment logging (`set_experiment`, `log_model`), setup config table reads/writes, loading graphs from MLflow runs.

**Why SP for MLflow?** There is no `mlflow` or `ml.experiments` OBO scope available for Databricks Apps. The SP is granted access to each user's experiment folder during the setup flow.

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

Users provide their PAT at deploy time for operations that need UC write access.

**Used for:** Model registration in Unity Catalog, schema creation, serving endpoint creation.

**Why PAT?** There are no UC write OBO scopes (only `catalog.*:read`). The PAT gives the user full permissions under their own identity. It is never stored.

**Implementation detail:** `create_pat_client()` and `mask_sp_env_vars()` in `auth.py` handle PAT-authenticated `WorkspaceClient` creation. For `mlflow.register_model()`, we use a subprocess because MLflow caches `DatabricksConfig` via `@lru_cache` on the registry store — env-var masking alone doesn't override it. See `_register_model_with_pat()` in `main.py`.

### Summary

| Operation | Auth | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Preview / Playground | OBO | User's data permissions apply |
| LLM calls (FMAPI) | SP | FMAPI doesn't accept OBO |
| MLflow experiment logging | SP | No `ml.experiments` OBO scope |
| Load graph from MLflow run | SP | Same as above; scoped by setup grants |
| Setup config table | SP | App-owned Delta table |
| Setup folder permission grant | OBO | User owns their workspace folder |
| Register model in UC | PAT | No UC write OBO scopes |
| Create serving endpoint | PAT | `model-serving` OBO scope unreliable |

## Lakebase Connection Handling

Conversational agents need persistent state. The app uses Lakebase (Databricks-managed PostgreSQL) as a checkpoint store. Understanding the connection pattern matters if you're modifying the deploy flow or `mlflow_model.py`.

### Why not a static connection string?

Lakebase Autoscaling uses OAuth tokens that expire after 1 hour. A `postgresql://user:token@host/db` URI baked into an env var stops working after the first hour. Model Serving endpoints are long-running, so static credentials don't work.

### The pattern: ConnectionPool with token refresh

Instead of a static connection string, the serving endpoint gets three env vars:

| Env var | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` | `projects/my-agent/branches/production/endpoints/primary` | Resource path for `generate_database_credential()` |
| `LAKEBASE_HOST` | `ep-abc123.database.us-east-1.databricks.com` | Postgres hostname |
| `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` | `checkpoints` | Postgres database name |

At serving time (`mlflow_model.py`), the model creates a `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool` with a custom `psycopg.Connection` subclass. Each time the pool opens a new connection, the subclass calls `WorkspaceClient().postgres.generate_database_credential(endpoint=...)` to get a fresh 1-hour OAuth token and passes it as the password.

Key facts:
- **Open connections survive token expiry.** Lakebase enforces expiry only at login time, not on established connections.
- **The pool handles rotation transparently.** Existing connections keep working; new ones get fresh tokens.
- **`WorkspaceClient()` auto-detects credentials** in the Model Serving environment (SP identity).
- **`PostgresSaver` accepts `ConnectionPool` directly** — LangGraph calls `pool.connection()` for each checkpoint read/write.

A `LAKEBASE_CONN_STRING` fallback exists for non-Lakebase Postgres instances but should be avoided for Lakebase deployments.

### The deploy flow

1. User chooses "Create new" or "Use existing" in the Deploy modal
2. If "Create new": the deploy endpoint calls `provision_lakebase()` (in `backend/lakebase.py`) using the user's PAT to create a project + database
3. The three env vars are injected on the `ServedEntityInput` when creating the serving endpoint
4. If the user provides a raw connection string instead, it's injected as `LAKEBASE_CONN_STRING` (legacy path)

### Auth summary for Lakebase

| When | Who | How |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning (deploy time) | User | PAT-authenticated `WorkspaceClient` |
| Token generation (serving time) | Service Principal | SP credentials auto-detected by `WorkspaceClient()` |
| Postgres connection (serving time) | SP identity | OAuth token as password, SP email as username |

## Pull Requests

### Guidelines

- **One feature per PR.** Don't bundle unrelated changes. A new node type, a bug fix, and a UI tweak should be three separate PRs.
- **Keep diffs small.** If a feature touches many files, consider breaking it into stacked PRs (e.g., backend first, then frontend).
- **Don't refactor while fixing.** If you notice nearby code that could be improved, open a separate PR for it.
- **Test before opening.** Run the app locally and verify your change works in the preview canvas. If you're adding a node, test it with at least one graph that exercises it.
- **Update CONTRIB.md** if your change adds new patterns, config field types, or resource declarations that other contributors need to know about.

### Branch naming

Use `your-name/short-description` — e.g., `brennan.beal/add-sql-warehouse-node`.

### PR template

The repo includes a PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Fill it out when opening a PR — don't delete sections, mark them N/A if they don't apply.

## Adding a New Node Type

The agent builder uses auto-discovery — drop a file in `backend/nodes/` and it appears in the UI automatically.

### 1. Create the node file

Add `backend/nodes/your_node.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Any
from .base import BaseNode, NodeConfigField
from . import register

@register
class YourNode(BaseNode):
    @property
    def node_type(self) -> str:
        return "your_node"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Your Node"

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "One-line description shown in the palette."

    @property
    def category(self) -> str:
        return "action"  # model | retrieval | action | control

    @property
    def icon(self) -> str:
        return "puzzle"  # must be in NodeIcon.tsx ICON_MAP

    @property
    def color(self) -> str:
        return "#6366f1"  # hex color for the node header

    @property
    def config_fields(self) -> list[NodeConfigField]:
        return [
            NodeConfigField(name="param1", label="Param 1"),
        ]

    def execute(self, state: dict[str, Any], config: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        writes_to = config.get("_writes_to", "")
        # ... your logic ...
        return {
            writes_to: result,
            "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "...", "node": "your_node"}],
        }
```

That's it for the backend. The `@register` decorator + `pkgutil` auto-import in `__init__.py` handles discovery. The node will appear in the palette and config panel automatically.

### 2. Add icon mapping (if using a new icon)

In `frontend/src/components/NodeIcon.tsx`, add your icon to `ICON_MAP`:

```tsx
import { YourIcon } from "lucide-react";
// ...
const ICON_MAP = {
  // ...existing...
  "your-icon": YourIcon,
};
```

Unmapped icons fall back to the puzzle piece. Browse options at [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev).

### 3. Add resource declarations (if accessing Databricks resources)

If your node references external resources (endpoints, tables, functions, etc.), update `backend/main.py` so Model Serving provisions credentials:

1. Add to `resource_map` in `_extract_resources()`
2. Add to `init_param` mapping
3. Add to `_RESOURCE_MAP` in `backend/notebook_gen.py` (for generated deploy notebooks)

Available resource classes:

| Class | Config field example | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabricksServingEndpoint` | `endpoint`, `endpoint_name` | LLM, Vector Search |
| `DatabricksVectorSearchIndex` | `index_name` | Vector Search |
| `DatabricksGenieSpace` | `room_id` | Genie |
| `DatabricksFunction` | `function_name` | UC Function |
| `DatabricksTable` | `table_name` | — |

### 4. Add as a tool (if tool-compatible)

If your node can also be used as a tool attached to an LLM node:

1. Set `tool_compatible = True` on the node class
2. Add a tool factory function in `backend/tools.py` (e.g., `_make_your_tool()`)
3. Register it in the `make_tools()` switch statement

Tool functions use `get_workspace_client()` for data access — same OBO auth as nodes.

## Config Field Types

The config panel renders fields automatically based on `field_type`:

| `field_type` | Renders as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"text"` | Text input | Default |
| `"number"` | Number input | |
| `"textarea"` | Multi-line text | |
| `"select"` | Dropdown | Provide `options` list |
| `"state_variable"` | Dropdown of state vars | Supports dot-path for structured fields |
| `"schema_editor"` | Structured field editor | For LLM structured output |
| `"route_editor"` | Route builder | Router nodes only |

## Reading from State

Use `resolve_state()` from `base.py` when your node reads from a user-selected state variable. It handles both flat keys (`"input"`) and dot-paths into structured fields (`"output.query_filters"`):

```python
from .base import resolve_state

query = resolve_state(state, config.get("query_from", "input"))
```

## Router Nodes

If your node branches the graph:

1. Add `is_router = True` property
2. Implement `get_route_names(config) -> list[str]`
3. Return `{"_route": chosen_key}` from `execute()`

See `backend/nodes/router_node.py` for reference.

## Execute Contract

Your `execute()` receives:
- `state` — full agent state dict
- `config` — user-supplied config values, plus `_writes_to` (target state field) and `_target_field` (the `StateFieldDef`)

It must return a dict with:
- `writes_to: value` — the result to write into the target state field
- `"messages": [...]` — list of message dicts for the execution trace (each with `role`, `content`, `node`)

## App Scopes

When adding integrations that call new Databricks APIs via OBO, you may need to add OAuth scopes in `databricks.yml` under `user_api_scopes`.

**Currently configured scopes:**

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sql` | SQL warehouse queries, statement execution |
| `serving.serving-endpoints` | Query serving endpoints (LLM nodes) |
| `catalog.catalogs:read` | Validate catalog access at deploy time |
| `catalog.schemas:read` | Validate schema access at deploy time |
| `catalog.tables:read` | Read UC tables |
| `vectorsearch.vector-search-endpoints` | Vector Search endpoint access |
| `vectorsearch.vector-search-indexes` | Vector Search index queries |

**Discovering available scopes:** Fetch the full list from your workspace's OAuth discovery endpoint:

```bash
databricks api get /oidc/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq '.scopes_supported'
```

**Important:** Not all scopes listed in the OAuth discovery endpoint work as OBO scopes for Apps. In particular, `mlflow`, `unity-catalog`, and `model-serving` appear in the list but do not reliably grant access when used as `user_api_scopes`. This is why the deploy flow uses PAT/SP instead of OBO for those operations.

If you get a 403 with "required scopes: X", add scope `X` to `databricks.yml` and redeploy.

## Quick Reference
